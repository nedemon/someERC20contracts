Most of the errors are like "don't do 4 spaces or similar"

Interesting ones: (slither, linter)
 - put a modifier to constructor
 - consts supposed to be all caps
 - access modifier has to be first in the list
 - do a semver - 0.8.4.0
 - do a zero-check on the constructor if any assignment is happening
 - add visibility to state constants
 - too many digits in contract names
 - blackList[from] == false compares to a boolean constant
